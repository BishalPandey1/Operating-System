i) Memory Management
 Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory
or Main Memory.
 Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly
by the CPU.
 For a program to be executed, it must be in the main memory.
An Operating System does the following activities for memory management:
 Keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., what part of it are in use by
whom, what part are not in use.
 In multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get
memory when and how much.
 Allocates the memory when a process requests it to do so.
 De-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has
been terminated.

ii) Processor Management
 In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides
which process gets the processor when and for how
much time.
 This function is called process scheduling.

An Operating System does the following activities for
processor management:
 Keeps tracks of processor and status of process.
 Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.
 De-allocates processor when a process is no longer
required.

iii) Device Management
 An Operating System manages device communication
via their respective drivers.
It does the following activities for device management:
 Keeps tracks of all peripheral devices.
 Decides which process gets the device when and for how
much time.
 Allocates the device in the most efficient way.
 De-allocates devices.

iv) File Management
 A file is normally organized into directories for easy
navigation and usage.
 These directories may contain files and other
directories.

An Operating System does the following activities for file
management:
 Keeps track of information, location, uses, status etc.
 Decides who gets the resources.
 Allocates the resources.
 De-allocates the resources.
